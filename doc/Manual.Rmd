## 1. Introduction

SDPR is software developed to predict the complex traits based on GWAS summary statistics. It fits a Bayesian nonparametric model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate the effect sizes of each SNP. SDPR is adaptive to different genetic architectures and does not rely on external validation datasets for parameter tuning.

## 2. Installation

Currently we have only tested SDPR on Linux x86 as SDPR explicitly uses SSE instruction. To install SDPR, you need to first download the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/eldronzhou/SDPR.git
```

There are two ways to install SDPR, assuming you are working on Linux x86. 

1. If you plan to run SDPR on a linux system with a modern intel processor, you may use the precompiled binary `SDPR`. Please make sure that dynamic libraries `gsl/lib/libgsl.so` and `MKL/lib/libmkl_rt.so` are not changed, otherwise SDPR is unable to load the libraries. If you are not able to run the MKL library, you can use openBLAS instead as described in the section below.

2. If you want to compile SDPR from the source for best performance, you need a C/C++ compiler like g++ (tested under version 4.8.5), GSL (version 2.60) and MKL library (version 2017). For convenience, we redistribute the compiled GSL and MKL building on our Intel Xeon Processors in the repo. To install, type `make`. If this version does not work, please report the error to the issue page. If the issue is related to GSL, you may want to download the source code of GSL and compile it yourself. For details about downloading and installing GSL, please refer to [this page](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) and [this page](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/usage.html#compiling-and-linking). A tutorial of installing gsl is given on this [page](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/jild13/2016/07/11/hello/). If you have other versions of MKL library, please refer to [this manual](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor.html) for linking advice. On AMD CPU, we recommend using OpenBLAS, please see [here](https://github.com/eldronzhou/SDPR/issues/3) for instructions.

You can run the test case to see whether SDPR is properly installed. 

```
cd test/

# make the refernce
../SDPR -make_ref -ref_prefix genotype/eur_chr22 -chr 22 -ref_dir ref/

# mcmc
../SDPR -mcmc -ref_dir ref/ -ss summary_stat/sim_1.txt -N 503 -chr 22 -out result/SDPR_chr22.txt
```

## 3. Input Files

SDPR requires two main input files: genotype of the reference panel and summary statistics. The genotype should be in the PLINK [bed](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bed) format. 

### 3.1 Reference LD Matrix

SDPR uses an empirical Bayes based shrinkage estimator to create the reference LD matrix. It then divide the LD matrix into approximately independent blocks so that SNPs in two blocks would not have nonignorable correlation ($r^2 < r2$, $r2 = 0.1$ as default). 

If you are working on summary statistics from EUR ancestry, you can download the [MHC included](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhZdUNG9GfCaeH3m0Ou7yE2Ljvp39-j7/view?usp=sharing) and [MHC removed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o-cqLDHfqouribbzlEjfM0ikedQ9H4jc/view?usp=sharing) reference LD directory consisting 1 million HapMap3 SNPs estimated from 503 1000 Genome EUR samples. If you are working on traits where MHC region is known to play an important role (e.g. autoimmune and infectious diseases), we recommend you to use the MHC version. You can also create the reference LD for your preferred reference panel by running the command below. 

```
# 1 thread 
for ${i} in {1..22}; do
./SDPR -make_ref -ref_prefix prefix_ref_genotype -chr ${i} -ref_dir SDPR_ref 
done

# parallel over chr and using 3 threads for each chromosome is recommended
```

If you have memory issues regarding the large size of blocks, you can increase the value of `-r2` to 0.3 or 0.4`. This will make the size of independent blocks smaller. 

### 3.2 Summary Statistics

The summary statistics should at least contain following columns with the same name (order of the column is not important).

```
SNP	A1	A2	BETA	P
rs737657        A       G       -2.044  0.0409
rs7086391       T       C       -2.257  0.024
rs1983865       T       C       3.652   0.00026
...
```

where SNP is the marker name, A1 is the effect allele, A2 is the alternative allele, BETA is the regression coefficient for quantitative traits or log odds ratio for binary traits, and P is the p value. 

We recommend to include the column N if the sample size for each SNP is available, for example

```
SNP     A1      A2      BETA    P       N
rs737657        A       G       -2.044  0.0409      252156
rs7086391       T       C       -2.257  0.024      248425
rs1983865       T       C       3.652   0.00026    253135
...
```

Raw public GWAS summary statistics usually contain SNPs that are not ideal for prediction. Thus, we recommend the following pipeline to process the summary statistics.

#### 3.2.1 Standard quality control

First, clean the summary statistics using `munge_sumstats.py` provided by [LDSC](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc). This will remove strand-ambiguous SNPs (A/T and G/C), INDELs, and SNPs with an effective sample size less than 0.67 times the 90th percentile of sample size.

```
python munge_sumstats.py --sumstats your_ss --out clean
```

#### 3.2.2 Conversion to the input format

Second, convert the cleaned summary statistics to the input format. For example, in R you can do

```
b = readr::read.tsv("clean.sumstats.gz", header=T, stringsAsFactors=F)
# if you have the list of snps you want to keep, you can run
# snp = read.table(path_to_snplist, stringsAsFactors=F)
# b = b[b$SNP %in% snp$V1,]
b = b[!is.na(b$Z),]
b$P = 2*pnorm(-abs(b$Z))
colnames(b) = c("SNP","A1","A2","BETA","N","P")
write.table(b[,c(1,2,3,4,6,5)], file="SDPR.txt", append=F, sep="\t", quote=F, row.names=F, col.names=T)
```

#### 3.2.3 Discrepancy between summary statistics and out of sample reference panel

Third, when using out-of-sample reference LD and public GWAS summary statistics, there are possibilities that model is mis-specified for SNPs (details in the manuscript). We consider two possibilities in SDPR: deflation of summary statistics and discrepancy for SNPs in strong LD. 

You can run LDSC to check whether there is deflation due to the use of double genomic control.

```
ldsc.py --h2 clean.sumstats.gz --ref-ld-chr path_to_ref 
--out ./clean_h2 --w-ld-chr path_to_ref
```

If the intercept output by LDSC is way smaller than 1, you may want to use [SumHer](http://dougspeed.com/sumher-server/) to obtain the correction factor and pass the squared root using the flag `-c`. For example, if the intercept is no less than 0.8, then it is safe to use the default value 1. If the intercept is 0.64, and the correction factor of SumHer is 0.5, then you can set the flag `-c ` to 0.7.

If you are using in-sample LD reference, you probably would not encounter the discrepancy for SNPs in strong LD. Unless SDPR reports the error of non-positive definite matrix, you can change the value of flag `-a` to 0. When using out-of-sample LD reference such as 1000 Genome, it is safe to set the flag `-a` to 0.1 (default) to make the model more robust. 

#### 3.2.4 Different sample sizes per SNP (Optional)

When the sample size of each SNP is different, the correlation of effect sizes in the summary statistics would be less than what is expected from the reference panel. This is usually not a concern since we have already used the modified likelihood function and SNPs with small sample size have been removed by standard quality control. 

However, sometimes SNPs relevant to certain traits may be genotyped on a specialized array in a separate cohort. For example, SNPs of GWAS summary statistics of lipid traits were genotyped on two arrays in two separate cohorts (GWAS chip: $N_1 \approx 95,000$; Metabochip: $N_2 \approx 94,000$). In this case, it is better to use another likelihood function for evaluation (-opt_llk 2). The summary statistics should include another column ARRAY indicating whether SNPs were genotyped on array 1 (coded as 1), array 2 (coded as 2), or both arrays (coded as 0). 

```
SNP     A1      A2      BETA    P       N       ARRAY
rs737657        G       A       2.082   0.0373424697223086      94311   1
rs7086391       C       T       0.081   0.935441952506118       94311   1
rs10786408      C       T       0.286   0.774878121554244       186924  0
rs782257        T       C       0.838   0.402030703498653       80386   2
...
```

Determining which array SNPs were genotyped on is usually impossible unless information regarding the study design is available. Based on our experience, we only encounter this situation when analyzing lipid traits. Users are welcomed to consult the author on how to set the array column for public summary statistics. An example to process the summary statistics and run SDPR with opt_llk2 can be found [here](https://github.com/eldronzhou/SDPR_paper/tree/main/UKB_real/HDL/summ_stats) and [here](https://github.com/eldronzhou/SDPR_paper/blob/main/UKB_real/HDL/result/SDPR/SDPR.sh).

## 4. Running SDPR

When running in parallel using (22*3 = 66 threads), SDPR is able to finish MCMC in around 15 minutes based on our experience.

```
# for chr i using 3 threads
# recommend to run each chr in parallel
./SDPR -mcmc -ref_dir ref/ -ss ss.txt -N 10000 -chr i -out res.txt -n_threads 3
```

Once having the output, one can use [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/score) to derive the PRS. 

```
plink --bfile test_geno --score res.txt 1 2 3 header --out test
```
